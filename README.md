 
# 🏡 Tehran House Price Prediction (2025)   
  

## 📌 Project Overview                    
This project aims to predict house prices in Tehran, Iran, using machine learning models. The dataset includes various features such as:  
✔️ Area         
✔️ Number of rooms           
✔️ Parking availability            
✔️ Warehouse          
✔️ Elevator presence           
✔️ Location                

By applying different regression models, we identify the best approach for accurate price prediction. 
 
## 📊 Dataset       
The dataset contains real estate information from Tehran, including house prices in local currency and USD. It has been preprocessed to ensure data quality and improve model performance.     

## ⚙️ Models Used              
We experimented with multiple models and fine-tuned hyperparameters to find the most effective predictor:           
🔹 Linear Regression                   
🔹 Lasso Regression                       
🔹 Decision Tree Regressor                    
🔹 Random Forest Regressor                    
🔹 XGBoost Regressor (Best Performing Model)                   

## 📈 Key Findings                            
✅ Area and price have a strong positive correlation—larger houses tend to be more expensive.           
✅ Features like elevator presence and address showed little impact on price.             
✅ XGBoost Regressor provided the best accuracy with minimal risk of overfitting.                

## 🛠 How to Use                      
1️⃣ Load the dataset into a Kaggle notebook or a local environment.            
2️⃣ Run the preprocessing steps to clean and encode the data.           
3️⃣ Train the model using the provided code and evaluate performance.             
4️⃣ Use the trained model to predict house prices based on user input.                   

## 📊 Results & Performance                    
🎯 Train Score: ~0.88            

🎯 Test Score: ~0.88             

✅ Minimal Overfitting: The model generalizes well to unseen data.                 

## 🚀 Future Improvements              
🔹 Adding more features such as neighborhood quality, market trends, and economic factors.                  
🔹 Exploring deep learning approaches for further accuracy improvement.                
🔹 Integrating real-time price updates for dynamic predictions.
